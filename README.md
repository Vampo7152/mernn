### To get project running on local site, 
   1.  `npm install` in root 
   2.  `npm install` in /frontend
   3.   All the envs are provided already use same, to set up stuff faster
   4.   `npm run dev` in root and it should work fine.
   
   
### ping me up if you get any error around. Though I don't get any error most of the time, others do get it sometime.
